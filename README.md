A 65% keyboard PCB that supports standard and arrow key blocker layouts (such as the kbd67) and stepped caps lock. The PCB also features a flex cut for a softer typing experience. Uses USB type C and has a ESD protection diode. PCB is tested and working. A matching case model can be found here via the fusion 360 link: https://a360.co/2X7CGb7 (Though there is a name engraving for myself in the top right that needs to be changed if you don't want it).
